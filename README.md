Hi everyone, i have made this E-Commerce website using Django(python).

it has a homepage and different pages up top and a search box as well.
i also made a signIn/signUp page.
added this contact link and different useful links in the footer.
i made different pages for different kind of products and a single product page as well.
if the products exceeds a fixed amount the products will be divided into different pages and a pages link will apear in the bottom.
i had limited images so they are used repeatedly. they are used again on different pages(so that you dont think that the pages are same, they are different only pics are used on different pages)

i basically made this website for a clothing company. but it can be used for different purposes as you only want to show your products and sell them. for other puposes i will make another maybe.

you can use it as a boiler plate for your next website by changing all the information to your needs!!
